## Project in Details:
### Used Dataset: [noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments)

The No Show Dataset is a Medical dataset that has information on over a 100 thousand medical appointments in Brazil. It focuses on whether the patients attended their appointments or missed it. It contains information on patients such as age, Gender, whether they suffer from chronic diseases, Alcoholism or Disability, and whether they are enrolled in Brazilian welfare program "Bolsa Fam√≠lia". We will the dataset in detail and analyze it to find the relation between the available features and attending the appointment.

The project goes through 3 steps:
  1. General exploration
  2. Wrangling and cleaning
  3. Exploration and analyzing

At the end after conducting the investigation we conclude our findings and the limitations we had during the investigation.
